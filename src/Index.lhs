title: LazyPPL
---

LazyPPL is a Haskell library for probabilistic programming. It supports lazy use of probability, and we provide new Metropolis-Hastings algorithms to allow this. LazyPPL is inspired by recent ideas in synthetic probability theory and synthetic measure theory such as [quasi-Borel spaces](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quasi-Borel+space) and [Markov categories](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Markov+category). Laziness appears to be a good paradigm for non-parametric statistics. LazyPPL is inspired by many other languages, including [Church](v1.probmods.org), [Anglican](https://probprog.github.io/anglican/), and [MonadBayes](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2019-09-20-monad-bayes-1/).

LazyPPL provides two monads:

* `Prob a`{.haskell}: probability measures, supporting probability measure such as `uniform :: Prob Double`{.haskell}, `normal :: Double -> Double -> Prob Double`{.haskell}, `bernoulli :: Double -> Prob Bool`{.haskell}. This is lazy, in other words it is an affine monad.
* `Meas a`{.haskell}: unnormalized measures, as used in Monte Carlo simulations for Bayesian statistics. There are two key functions:
  * `sample :: Prob a -> Meas a`{.haskell}, which samples from a probability measure;
  * `score :: Double -> Meas ()`{.haskell}, which weights a measure by a given value, typically coming from a likelihood function.


Simple example

To illustrate the basic usage, here is a very simple first example, that doesn't use laziness. More advanced examples are in the menu above and further examples in the [Bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/lazyppl).

Suppose we we know that there are fewer buses on Sundays than on other days. I notice 4 buses in an hour, what is the probability it is a Sunday? 
\begin{code}
model :: Meas Bool
model = do
  -- Prior belief: it is Sunday with prob. 1/7
  sunday <- sample $ bernoulli (1/7)
  -- I know the rates of buses on the different days:
  let rate = if sunday then 3 else 10 
  -- observe 4 buses
  score $ poissonPdf rate 4
  return sunday
\end{code}
We run a Metropolis-Hastings simulation to get a stream of draws from this unnormalized measure. We plot a histogram of the results, which shows the posterior probability that it is Sunday, given that we saw 4 buses.
\begin{code}
inference :: IO ()
inference = do
  xws <- mh 1 model
  plotHistogram "images/index-posterior.svg" (map fst $ take 1000 xws)
\end{code}
